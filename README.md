# Followed a mockup to make a fully functioning website using bootstrap.

# Peer Review:
# Caleb Sylvia - The navbar has a component on bootstrap that will create a dropdown menu when screen becomes smaller really easy to set up, font-family needs to be changed for of the components, may be a hassle but setting seperate classes for one part will make a big difference. The site is pretty well set up just need to space some spots such as the cards differently and it should come together pretty well. When doing the fonts you have to include the whole font-family parameters such as Dosis, sans-serif. On the reserve box there is a bit of extra blue on the sides, there is an automatic padding with some of bootstraps css so you can get rid of this by setting padding on the sides to whatever size you need it to be to get rid of excess and add !important to it as well so it overwrites the bootstrap css. As regards to responsiveness the hiding elements will become your best friend as well as media queries, there are many things that can be removed to make the screen look less cluttered when going to smaller device view. Overall the site is pretty good and most parts match up besides a couple minor fixes, keep up the amazing work king!
